## DESCRIPTION:

Jobbot is an application that makes applying for jobs easier. You only have to enter your Linkedin credentials, and Jobbot does the rest!

Jobbot will essentially scan through your Linkedin profile curate a high quality, professional resume just for you, which gets auto-downloaded into your system.
